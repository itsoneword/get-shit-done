<purpose>

Start a new milestone cycle for an existing project. Loads context, gathers goals, updates PROJECT.md/STATE.md, optionally runs parallel research, defines scoped requirements with REQ-IDs, spawns roadmapper for phased execution plan, and commits artifacts.

</purpose>

<required_reading>

Read all files referenced by the invoking prompt's execution_context before starting.

</required_reading>

<process>

## 1. Load Context

Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `--reset-phase-numbers` → restart roadmap numbering at `1`
- remaining text → milestone name

Without the flag, continue phase numbering from previous milestone.

Read: PROJECT.md, MILESTONES.md, STATE.md, MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md (if exists from /gsd2:discuss-milestone).

## 2. Gather Milestone Goals

**If MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md exists:** Use its features/scope, present summary for confirmation.

**If no context file:**
- Present what shipped in last milestone
- Ask inline (freeform, NOT AskUserQuestion): "What do you want to build next?"
- Wait for response, then probe specifics via AskUserQuestion
- If user selects "Other" for freeform input, ask follow-up as plain text — not another AskUserQuestion

## 3. Determine Milestone Version

Parse last version from MILESTONES.md, suggest next (v1.0 → v1.1, or v2.0 for major), confirm with user.

## 4. Update PROJECT.md

Add/update:

```markdown
## Current Milestone: v[X.Y] [Name]

**Goal:** [One sentence describing milestone focus]

**Target features:**
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
- [Feature 3]
```

Update Active requirements section and "Last updated" footer.

Ensure `## Evolution` section exists. If missing, add before footer:

```markdown
## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd2:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd2:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
```

## 5. Update STATE.md

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: [today] — Milestone v[X.Y] started
```

Keep Accumulated Context from previous milestone.

## 6. Cleanup and Commit

Delete MILESTONE-CONTEXT.md if exists (consumed).

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs: start milestone v[X.Y] [Name]" --files .planning/PROJECT.md .planning/STATE.md
```

## 7. Load Context and Resolve Models

```bash
INIT=$(node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" init new-milestone)
if [[ "$INIT" == @file:* ]]; then INIT=$(cat "${INIT#@file:}"); fi
```

Extract from init JSON: `researcher_model`, `synthesizer_model`, `roadmapper_model`, `commit_docs`, `research_enabled`, `current_milestone`, `project_exists`, `roadmap_exists`, `latest_completed_milestone`, `phase_dir_count`, `phase_archive_path`.

## 7.5 Reset-phase safety (only when `--reset-phase-numbers`)

If active:
1. Set starting phase number to `1`.
2. If `phase_dir_count > 0`, archive old phase directories before roadmapping to prevent collisions.

If `phase_dir_count > 0` and `phase_archive_path` available:

```bash
mkdir -p "${phase_archive_path}"
find .planning/phases -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -exec mv {} "${phase_archive_path}/" \;
```

Verify `.planning/phases/` is clear before continuing.

If `phase_dir_count > 0` but `phase_archive_path` missing: Stop — tell user to complete/archive previous milestone first, then rerun with `--reset-phase-numbers`.

## 8. Research Decision

Check `research_enabled` from init JSON.

**If `research_enabled` is `true`:**
AskUserQuestion: "Research the domain ecosystem for new features before defining requirements?"
- "Research first (Recommended)" — Discover patterns, features, architecture for NEW capabilities
- "Skip research for this milestone" — Go straight to requirements

**If `research_enabled` is `false`:**
AskUserQuestion: "Research the domain ecosystem for new features before defining requirements?"
- "Skip research (current default)" — Go straight to requirements
- "Research first" — Discover patterns, features, architecture for NEW capabilities

**MUST NOT** persist this choice to config.json — WHY: the `workflow.research` setting controls plan-phase behavior globally; changing it here would silently alter future `/gsd2:plan-phase` runs.

**If user chose "Research first":**

## 9. Define Requirements

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 GSD ► DEFINING REQUIREMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

Read PROJECT.md for core value, milestone goals, validated requirements.

**If research exists:** Read FEATURES.md, present by category:
```
## [Category 1]
**Table stakes:** Feature A, Feature B
**Differentiators:** Feature C, Feature D
**Research notes:** [any relevant notes]
```

**If no research:** Ask "What are the main things users need to do with [new features]?" — clarify, probe, group into categories.

**Scope each category** via AskUserQuestion (multiSelect: true, header max 12 chars):
- "[Feature 1]" — [brief description]
- "[Feature 2]" — [brief description]
- "None for this milestone" — Defer entire category

Selected → this milestone. Unselected table stakes → future. Unselected differentiators → out of scope.

**Identify gaps** via AskUserQuestion:
- "No, research covered it" — Proceed
- "Yes, let me add some" — Capture additions

**Generate REQUIREMENTS.md:** v1 requirements grouped by category (checkboxes, REQ-IDs), future requirements, out of scope (with reasoning), traceability section (empty, filled by roadmap).

**REQ-ID format:** `[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]` (AUTH-01, NOTIF-02). Continue from existing.

Requirements must be: specific/testable, user-centric ("User can X"), atomic (one capability each), independent.

Present full list for confirmation:

```
## Milestone v[X.Y] Requirements

### [Category 1]
- [ ] **CAT1-01**: User can do X
- [ ] **CAT1-02**: User can do Y

### [Category 2]
- [ ] **CAT2-01**: User can do Z

Does this capture what you're building? (yes / adjust)
```

If "adjust": return to scoping.

```bash
node "$HOME/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" commit "docs: define milestone v[X.Y] requirements" --files .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
